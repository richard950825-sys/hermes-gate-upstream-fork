# Hermes Gate Getting Started Guide

## First Time

### 1. One-Click Start

```bash
./start.sh
```

The first run will automatically build the Docker image and launch the TUI interactive interface. No configuration files needed.

After entering, select "➕ Add Server..." and input:

```
username@ip_address       e.g. root@1.2.3.4
username@hostname         e.g. admin@myserver
username@hostname:port    e.g. root@1.2.3.4:2222
```

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- SSH private key (`id_rsa` or `id_ed25519`) in local `~/.ssh` directory, added to the target server's `authorized_keys`
- Remote server has `tmux` and `hermes` installed

## Daily Use

```bash
./start.sh              # Start and enter container (skips build if already built)
./start.sh --rebuild    # Force rebuild then start
```

The container stops automatically when you exit the TUI.

## Hot Reload

Python code under `hermes_gate/` is mounted via a Docker volume. After modification, **no rebuild is needed** — just restart the container.

The following files **require a rebuild** (`./start.sh --rebuild`) after changes:

- `pyproject.toml`
- `requirements.txt`
- `entrypoint.sh`
- `Dockerfile`

## Common Docker Commands

```bash
docker compose down              # Stop and remove container
docker compose logs hermes-gate  # View logs
docker exec -it hermes-gate bash # Enter container shell
```

## Notes

- Make sure you have SSH keys (`id_rsa` or `id_ed25519`) in your local `~/.ssh` directory before starting
- The container stops automatically when you exit the TUI; just run `./start.sh` again next time
